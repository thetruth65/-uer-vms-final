# Note: jellyfish is used for phonetic name matching (Soundex algorithm)
# It's a pure Python library for approximate string matching

## Installation Order (for manual setup):
# 1. System dependencies (via apt-get in Dockerfile)
# 2. pip install face-recognition (this includes dlib which needs cmake)
# 3. pip install remaining packages

## Alternative if face-recognition fails:
# You can use a simpler approach with just OpenCV for face detection
# and skip the encoding comparison. For a hackathon demo, this is acceptable.

# SIMPLIFIED VERSION (if face-recognition installation fails):
# fastapi==0.109.0
# uvicorn[standard]==0.27.0
# opencv-python-headless==4.8.1.78
# pillow==10.2.0
# python-multipart==0.0.6
# jellyfish==1.0.3
# pydantic==2.5.3
